in 2017 I was in my Junior year of highschool and decided I wanted to learn a language. I chose Japanese because I liked anime and video games so I had been exposed to it a little before. Originally I started on the new (for the time) Duolingo course on Japanese. I soon realized I wouldn't learn much from it, as Duolingo is good for practice, not learning. I searched for resources and found the [DJT](https://djtguide.neocities.org/) and started on [Namasense's Japanese Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9987A659670D60E0) on youtube.
<br><br>
After studying on my own using that and using the [Core2k/6k deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1880390099) (its good but also really out of date with its vocab), I took 2 years of classes in college.<br>
After finishing those classes in 2020, I was at about an N4 level (I've never taken the test.) I couldn't have conversations and could only read a little.
From there, I started reading manga I enjoyed, particularly Yotsubato and Shimeji Simulation. But I didnt study consistently afterward. I had other things going on in my life. 
<br><br>
A year or so after, I went through a big breakup, and afterwards, I started to consider studying abroad. I knew that if i entered into another relationship, I was likely to never take that leap and go abroad later in life. However, that was in the middle of covid, so I couldnt go abroad yet.<br>
To prepare myself, and to make sure I was fluent enough to really get a lot out of the experience, I started to study again. I also fell into the rabbit hole of Vtubers and got a lot of listening exposure listening to vtubers like Okayu.
<br><br>
The year (2022) prior to studying abroad, I started to push myself to try to read more, and particularly to try to meet people on discord. I joined language learning servers (which I had done before) but I tried especially to join language learning servers with a mostly Japanese userbase. After a bit of searching around, I met some very kind and accepting people, and made some friends. I would talk with them and occasionally play video games, and take note of the words I didn't know so I could study later. This effort paid off and by the time I went to study abroad, I could confidentally have casual conversations with others.<br>
Additionally, when I studied abroad, I got to meet most of my online friends, and had a wonderful time.
<br><br>
When I was in tokyo (Spring 2023) I took a full courseload of classes which taught Japanese to foreign students. This was great as I got to learn a lot more of the language very quickly. However, making Japanese friends beyond just my online friends was difficult, since I didn't share any classes with Japanese students. I spent most of my time during study abroad making friends with the other foreign exchange students, while occasionally hanging out with my online friends in person. But I think, even though I didn't end up speaking Japanese as often as I would have liked, making new friends with other english speakers was a great experience.<br>
I also read a lot of new manga on the train since I discovered Kindle Japan was very convenient. I highly recommend it. And Bookoff is great.
<br><br>
After studying abroad, I would gauge myself at about an N3 level (I still havent taken the test yet since it's difficult to take it where I live.)<br>
From what I understood from meeting others learning Japanese, getting to N2 level is really as high as you would ever need. To get from N3 to N2 you need to study and read new material in various subjects, similar to how you would take classes in school. Daily conversation doesn't go this deep.
<br><br>
It's a long journey to fluency. I am not there yet. Some get there in "3" years, grinding their life away with reading and flashcards while not experiencing the world around them. Some get there in decades. Everyone's different. It has taken me 6 years so far and along the way I've been getting a degree, going through breakups and new love, etc. and enjoying life. I don't expect to be fluent for a long time, but I know that as long as I continue to read books I like, make friends and talk to people I like, and use the language while doing so, I know I'll get better.
<br><br>
Don't ask "how long does it take to be fluent in Japanese?" instead ask "What can I do today to learn a little more?" <br>
Fluency is kind of overkill anyway. Being conversational is enough.<br>
Its ok to take a decade. Just keep on learning whatever you want to learn, and don't get yourself down when people ask how long you've been studying.
