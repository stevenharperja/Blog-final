LISTS:
<br>
*[Daily Japanese Thread](https://djtguide.neocities.org/)*

<br><br>
List written by me:<br><br>
**level: I have no experience**<br><br>

*[Genki 1-2](https://www.amazon.com/Genki-Third-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese/dp/4889969446/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3OWK8DILL0TYK&keywords=genki&qid=1702160560&sprefix=genki%2Caps%2C242&sr=8-5)* a cheap-ish textbook which teaches up to about N4. Most classes use it, and it starts with business focused Japanese. (i wish i had an affiliate link lol)
<br><br>
*[Tae Kim's guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/)* teaches grammar from a fundementals standpoint. I used it only a little
<br><br>
*[Core 2k/6k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1880390099)* Covers a lot of words. I recommend you remove cards you run into which dont feel relevant. Don't worry if you don't finish the whole thing.
<br><br>

**level: I know most grammar, all hiragana, katakana, and maybe know ~300 kanji and a lot of words**<br><br>
Start reading manga! it *will* be hard. you *won't* feel ready. Do it anyway. Whip out a dictionary and follow along with a book, write down the words you don't know and do flashcards after reading.
