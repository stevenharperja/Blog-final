Keep in mind these are by learning at what I would consider a slightly inconsistent, but reasonable pace<br><br>
Levels are gauged based on **[this list](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html)** <br><br>

**N5**<br>
takes about a year of studying grammar and words
<br><br>
**N4**<br>
takes about 2-3 years from zero. of studying grammar and words<br>
Not quite conversational yet
<br><br>
**N3** <- where this author is!<br>
takes like idk 5 years from zero. in my experience, you wont get here unless you push yourself by reading,writing,speaking, and/or listening beyond your comfort zone.<br><br>
**N2**<br>
Not really sure how long it takes to get here. I'm guessing you could get here by using Japanese like it was your everyday language, and by studying difficult, school-oriented subjects in Japanese.
<br><br>
**N1**<br>
Don't worry about getting here. if you've gotten here you probably wouldn't care about getting here anymore anyway.
